Before graduation, I accepted a job from three ex-Googlers as the founding designer at Stamped, their NYC startup. In our tiny one-room office, I learned much: That UI wasn’t UX, and visual skill crashes on the rocks of product development. That I depended on the mentorship of the senior designer hired soon after me. That virality and celebrity were demotivators for me. That a good, useful, promising idea is secondary to VC-driven exit strategy. And that being an obstinate, immature employee will get you fired. Still, I’m proud of the contribution I made to Stamped: it was a unique and useful app, good enough to be acquihired by Yahoo. And ten years later, nothing has replaced its solution to the recommendation problem.
