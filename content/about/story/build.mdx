When CBRE acquired Floored in December 2016, our team entered adulthood as an organization. As we began to understand the business of commercial real estate, [I created CBRE Build](/work/cbre-build/), a new brand positioning us as CBRE’s electric innovators. With it we recruited our first ever product managers, UX researchers, and a Director of Design. My practice matured an order of magnitude as I saw what I’d been missing without the support of a design mentor and the push-pull of collaboration with business, product, and engineering. I finally grasped that a designer is more a mechanic than an artist.
