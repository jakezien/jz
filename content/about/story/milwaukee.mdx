My door to this world opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, "A great place on a Great Lake." Growing up in the Heartland, among plains paved by glaciers, imbued empathy and a level perspective. (These qualities turned out to be the gooey center necessary for adulthood as a resilient New Yorker.) Milwaukee is a lovely hometown â€” it's a beautiful, underrated city, full of enormous, lush parks, sparkling lake views, strangers who make eye contact and say hello, and food that touts its ample use of butter.
