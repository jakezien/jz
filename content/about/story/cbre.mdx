In February 2020 — *before* COVID — CBRE abruptly fired 50 of the 60 Build NYC employees, including every engineer, Floored cofounder, and member of leadership. Among the lucky ten survivors were our Director of Design and two product designers, including me. The Build brand died that day, plunging us into the matrix of CBRE’s org structure. But this gave our Director access to disparate designers and researchers across the globe, whom she plucked from their silos; slowly, an empowered, companywide UX team emerged. And closer collaboration with the rest of CBRE provided a rare and invaluable education in the relationship between a business’s objectives, its org structure, and the products it can successfully make.
