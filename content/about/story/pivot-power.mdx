At RISD’s summer 2006 precollege program, I studied industrial design, and my final project was to design, model, and present a product of my choosing. I worked on an idea that had been knocking around my head for a while: a power strip that could extend to accomodate bulky plug adapters.

At my mom’s insistence, I worked with a family friend who was a patent lawyer to look into protecting the idea. We never patented the concept, but we found no one else had, either.  But a few years later, he told me he’d an airline magazine article about a startup called Quirky. They purported to do just what I needed: their website hosted an open call for invention ideas, and a community that could vote them up. Every week, the most popular submissions were evaluated by the company for development. If the idea survived prototyping and garnered enough presales, it would become a real, manufactured product,  packaged in a box with a photo of the “inventor,” and sold online and in stores like Target and Bed Bath and Beyond. Best of all, the inventor was paid a royalty for every unit sold.

So, bored in class one afternoon in 2010, I submitted my project to Quirky. Within a week it had been picked for development, and within a year it was shipping.
