My 10-year story with Floored  began in 2012, when affable investor Dave Eisenberg invited me to meet his two cofounders and demo their startupâ€™s 3D scanning tech. I saw opportunity to work on novel problems with a sharp group, and took the job as founding designer and employee #2. I made a company logo and website. Then over four years, I grew the role and my knowledge, adapting and staying useful. I learned UX, front-end dev, the need for competent product management, and the limits of what great engineering and sales can do without product-market fit. I saw the irreplaceable value of a phenomenal work culture, and learned how to build and maintain it. I learned how to evolve a brand as the company grew through infancy, adolescence, young-adulthood, and acquisition by CBRE.
