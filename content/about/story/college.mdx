Choosing a school was a dilemma: Carnegie Mellon, a university with a great design program, or Rhode Island School of Design, “art Harvard.” Reasoning that I shouldn't forgo academics, I chose CMU. But when design left no time for other classes, I felt I might as well be at design school — and anyway, my heart belonged to RISD. I transferred after one semester. 

In Providence, I complemented graphic design at RISD with computer science at Brown. The combination yielded unexpected connections and valuable  about perception and cognition, about the process of exploration and iteration.
