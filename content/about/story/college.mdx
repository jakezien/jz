I knew I wanted to study design in college, but I was ambivalent about which of my top choices to choose. Carnegie Mellon was a fine university with a great design program, but Rhode Island School of Design was “art Harvard,” and I’d attended and loved its precollege program the summer before my big decision. But, reasoning that I didn’t want to forgo academics entirely, I chose CMU. Within a semester I knew I had chosen wrong. I didn’t mind that the demanding design curriculum left no time for other studies; but if I was going to spend all my time on design, I might as well do it at design school — and anyway, my heart belonged to RISD. I transferred during my first winter break. 

In Providence, I was thrilled to find the flexibile education I'd wanted: RISD students are free to register for any class at Brown. I took the opportunity to pair graphic design with computer science, and was surprised to discover the two had much in common, with each discipline yielding lessons about the other. Both were visual and technical, both touched on perception and cognition, and both cultivated a mindset of creative exploration, rigorous execution, and iteration.
