Choosing a college paralyzed me with ambivalence: Carnegie Mellon, a university with a great design program, or Rhode Island School of Design, “art Harvard.” Reasoning that I shouldn't forgo academics, I chose CMU. But design left no time for other subjects, and I felt that if I'd be in studio day and night, I might as well be at design school — and anyway, my heart belonged to RISD. I transferred my first winter break. 

In Providence I found balance through classes at Brown. I paired graphic design with computer science, and each yielded insight about the other: both explored perception and cognition, and both taught a mindset of creative exploration, rigorous execution, and iteration.
