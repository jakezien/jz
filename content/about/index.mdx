## Who I am 
I’m Jake Zien, a composition of trillions of cells living on a round mossy rock floating in nothing.


## What I’m like
I am cerebral and have a sense of humor that is dry and crude. I take pride in being a good storyteller, but it's hard for me to say so because I think humility is very important. I will not let you exit the elevator before me, but I will probably walk too fast and get ahead of you by accident. I really like making you laugh, but I like learning from you more. 


## What I do
I’m a design thinker with a decade of experience working across the product development process, from business strategy, discovery and definition, to execution, delivery and ongoing iteration. I’m especially interested in how the structure of an organization, the culture of its people, and the way things are currently done act as constraints on making something new.

My path began with a degree in graphic design and programming. This honed my visual skills and opened an interest in positioning, semiotics, perception, and how meaning is made. My early jobs in UI design led me to UX, and ultimately to a blend of responsibilities that draw on Product Management, team leadership, experience design, information architecture, branding, and front-end development.
