## About me

<p class="bigText">I am trillions of individual, living cells that comprise a person called Jake Zien.</p>

I, too, am one cell of a bigger, weirder organism that is just beginning to figure out that that is what it is. I live on a round mossy rock floating in nothing.

I approach life with a design mindset: curious, empathetic, skeptical; eager to learn, absorb, and improve myself and the world around me. I think that a designer is not an artist, but a mechanic: one who fixes problems of behavior and communication.

## About design
<p class="bigText">Design is learning, shaping, and trying.</p>

In 1994, my mom installed a Macintosh 635CD in the livingroom, seeding my interest in something visual, technical, and exploratory. I didn’t know what it was until she used the word "design" to describe what had captured my attention about a dresser in a furniture store. The seed rooted.

The seed sprouted in adolescent hours exploring the menu systems of video games, browsing the websites of Phillipe Starck and Apple and Alessi, and dissecting the minutiae of car consoles with my dad.

In college I studied graphic design and programming, which honed my visual skill and sparked my interest in perception, behavior and cognition. My early jobs in visual design led me to UX, and as I pulled that thread, I found that being a "designer" gave me license to pursue business strategy, product management, information architecture, research and interviewing, branding and positioning, developing software, presenting to an audience, leading a team, and configuring an organization.

Today, I see design is less about the shape of a dresser, and more about shaping behavior. I'm interested in why things are the way they are, and design is a way to create better answers for that "why" through study, intervention, and iteration. Design is like us: rational and reasoned, yet inspired and inventive.

## About this website
<p class="bigText">"What do you do?”</p>

There's a common complaint about this icebreaker: it sucks. I agree. It's reductive, and it's boring. 

So in making a website that introduces me, my goal is to do more than answer that question. I’d like to transmit a fuller sense of my personhood than the bit that does commerce. “Product designer” is a pigeonhole, and I’m open to meaningful experiences that match my values and interests, not my title.

This is what I came up with: a site that tells you how I think, what I care about, what I like, and, yes, what I do. It's a place for me to put my voice that isn't owned by some platform.

## Colophon
The typefaces used on this website are <a href="http://colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/pantograph/" class="pantograph">Pantograph</a>, by Studio Makgill, published by Colophon Foundry, and <a href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/covik">Covik Sans</a>, by James Edmonson of OH no Type Co.

I wrote the site in Sublime Text 3 on a 15" MacBook Pro with an HP Z32 display, an Apple Magic Keyboard, and an Apple Magic Trackpad 2. I built it with the help of a long list of open-source software that made development a genuine pleasure, especially Gatsby.js, MDX, and Styled-Components.
