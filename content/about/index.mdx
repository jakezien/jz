## About me

<p class="bigText">I am trillions of individual, living cells that comprise a person called Jake Zien.</p>

I, too, am one cell of a bigger, weirder organism that is just beginning to figure out that that is what it is. I live on a round mossy rock floating in nothing.

## About design
<p class="bigText">Design is learning, shaping, and trying.</p>

My interest in design was seeded by the Macintosh 635CD that my mom installed in the livingroom in 1994. Soon after, the seed took root in a furniture store, where my mom used the word "design" to describe what it was about a dresser that had captured my attention. 

The seed sprouted in exploring the menu systems of video games; in adolescent hours browsing the websites of Phillipe Starck and Alessi and Apple; in conversations with my dad about the minutiae of interaction with cars' center consoles. 

In college I studied graphic design and programming, which honed my visual skill and sparked my interest in perception, behavior and cognition. My early jobs in UI design led me to UX, and as I pulled that thread, I found that being a "designer" gave me license to pursue responsibilities as broad as business strategy, product management, information architecture, research and interviewing, branding and positioning, software development, presenting before a crowd, leading a team, and configuring an organization.

Today, I see design as less about what makes a dresser look interesting, and more about the forces that shape behavior. I'm interested in why things are the way they are, and I see design as a way to create better answers for that "why" through study, intervention, and iteration. And I think design is like us: rational and reasoned, yet inspired and inventive.

## About this website
<p class="bigText"> There's a common complaint that when we introduce ourselves, the default icebreaker sucks.</p>

"What do you do?" I agree: it's reductive, and it's boring. 

So in making a website that introduces me, my goal is to do more than answer that question. I want to transmit a fuller sense of my personhood, not just the bit that does commerce. I mean, if I led with "Jake Zien is a product designer based in NYC," then I'd pigeonhole myself into quite a narrow definition, potentially missing out on interesting challenges that fit what I value, but not whatever the label "product designer" means.

So instead, this is what I came up with: a site that tells you how I think, what I care about, what I like, and, yes, what I do. It's a place for me to make my voice heard that isn't owned by some platform.

## Colophon
The typefaces used on this website are <a href="http://colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/pantograph/" class="pantograph">Pantograph</a>, by Studio Makgill, published by Colophon Foundry, and <a href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/covik">Covik Sans</a>, by James Edmonson of OH no Type Co.

I wrote the site in Sublime Text 3 on a 15" MacBook Pro with an HP Z32 display, an Apple Magic Keyboard, and an Apple Magic Trackpad 2. I built it with the help of a long list of open-source software that made development a genuine pleasure, especially Gatsby.js, MDX, and Styled-Components.
