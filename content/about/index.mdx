# About

## About me
I am trillions of individual, living cells that comprise a person called Jake Zien. I, too, am one cell of a bigger, weirder organism that is just beginning to figure out that that is what it is. I live on a round mossy rock floating in nothing.

My door to this world opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, "a great place on a Great Lake." Growing up in the Heartland, among plains paved by glaciers, imbued empathy and a level perspective. These qualities turned out to be the gooey center necessary for adulthood as a resilient New Yorker. I like life in New York City, because I like to walk as much as possible, to be exposed to the greatest diversity of ideas and people as possible, and to eat as many good breakfast sandwiches as possible. I like that New York City is the America of America.

## About design
My interest in design was seeded by the Macintosh 635CD that my mom installed in the livingroom in 1994. The seed took root in a furniture store soon after, where she used the word "design" to describe what it was about a dresser that had captured my attention. It sprouted in exploring the menu systems of video games; in adolescent hours browsing the websites of Phillipe Starck and Alessi and Design Within Reach; in conversations with my dad about the minutae of interaction with cars' center consoles. 

In college I studied graphic design and programming, which honed my visual skill and sparked my interest in perception, positioning, and behavior. My early jobs in UI design led me to UX, and as I pulled that thread, I found that being a "designer" gave me license to pursue responsibilities as broad as business strategy, product management, information architecture, branding and positioning, front-end development, giving presentations, team leadership, and configuring an organization. 

Today, I see design as being less about what makes a dresser interesting, and more about the forces that shape behavior. Design works by studying things’ behavior, creating an intervention, measuring its effect, and iterating. Design marries the scientific method and the creative process. It’s like us: both rational and inventive. I think that’s really cool.

## About this website
There's a common complaint that when we introduce ourselves, the default icebreaker sucks. "What do you do?" I agree: it's reductive, and it's boring. 

So in making a website that introduces me, my goal is to do more than simply answer that question. Instead, I want to transmit a fuller sense of my personhood, not just the bit that does commerce. I mean, if I led with "Jake Zien is a product designer based in NYC," then I'd be pigeonholing myself into quite a narrow definition, potentially missing out on opportunities that better fit what I value and how I think.

So this is what I came up with: a site that tells you how I think, what I care about, what I like, and, yes, what I do. It's a place for me to make my voice heard that isn't owned by a platform.

## Colophon
The typefaces used on this website are Pantograph, by Studio Makgill, published by Colophon Foundry, and Covik Sans, by James Edmonson of OH no Type Co.

The site was written in Sublime Text 3 on a 15" MacBook Pro with an HP Z32 display, an Apple Magic Keyboard, and an Apple Magic Trackpad 2. It was built with a long list of open-source software that made development a genuine pleasure, especially Gatsby.js, MDX, and Styled-Components.
