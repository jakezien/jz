## There's nothing here right now.

<p class="bigText"> I have a lot to say, and a lot of ideas for posts.<br/>But I haven't written any of them yet. </p>

I plan to make a habit of writing in 2021, so I'm leaving this page here as a stub to remind myself to come back and fill it in. Maybe it will make you come back, too, to see if I've made good on this plan.

In the meantime, here are some ideas I have collected that I might want to write about. 

- The weird tangle of feelings that keeps me from engaging with social media
- Parallels between my generation's development from childhood into adulthood and the evolution of personal technology
- The design workflow's evolution towards git, and the flawed 40-year-old assumptions inherent in design tools
- Atheism, Judaism, identity, the baby and the bathwater
- Are Millennials a clipper ship generation?
- 19th-century personal technology, Dieter Rams, and the inevitability of UX as a response to the nature of screens
- What I didn't learn in design school
- What I've learned from reading news about Apple every day for 20 years
- The internet as a species-level event that we still haven't fully grokked
- Joy, contentment, and why people are unhappy
- Notes on my experience of trying to de-Google my life
- The brain as an organ that eats information and poops attention
