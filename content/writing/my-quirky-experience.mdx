- Quick overview of the idea and submission story
      webcam and card table

 - I was named an Inventor and this felt good, but I later came to question that label
      someone else at the company designed the final product, I merely seeded the idea
      reality is that design, especially product design, especially hardware design, is always a team effort
      I felt uncomfortable pretty immediately being given all the credit for this when the humble, hardworking, extremely talented industrial designers and engineers at quirky who made my sketch a feasible reality were never mentioned (though their names were included on the many patents Quirky bought to protect its work — after mine.)
      Instead my story was enthusiastically promoted by the company: teenager from no-name city creates bestselling invention
            I became the literal posterboy
            I was brought to New York for photo shoots, given paperwork to sign the rights to my name and likeness
                  It was for the packaging. But soon I was getting messages from people in my middle school class that a life-size cutout of me was standing at the endcap of their safeway
                  I felt a strange knot of things I couldn't name. I was excited for the success, and the royalty payments were wonderful. But I was finding out that being promoted made me uncomfortable
            They brought me back to new york to celebrate the launch with a whole-team party in a nightclub on top of a tribeca hotel. I was the surprise guest. They brought me out in front of everyone and handed me one of those giant checks. 
           
            I was brought back to shoot episodes of a pilot season of a Quirky reality show. The office above the Best Buy on Broadway was suddenly cramped; the production team's cameras jostled for space among the dozen new hires. The producer and Ben informed me that because my product was already on the manufacturing line, we'd have to go back and playact some meetings that had already happened in order to provide footage of the whole story. We'd be focusing on moments natural to the design process, where problems that were unforeseen — but never unexpected — crop up, and we have to backtrack a little, adjust things, reevaluate our assumptions to make it work.  These moments had in reality been communicated to me in public blog posts, on the phone but after the fact, or not at all. But now we were to reenact these "inflection points," as face-to-face meetings, and as we did could we please play up the uncertainty? Ben found it as silly as I did, but when he "broke the news" about the potential delay on camera, I reacted with my real reaction, "Ok, makes sense, that's part of the process," and so on. This company was doing a lot on my behalf; the idea that it'd take more than the insane one-year timeline to make this thing was in no way upsetting. The producer wasn't happy. We had to reshoot again and again until I gave them the sense of conflict they were looking for — my annoyance at this manufactured reality came through. I held no pretense that reality TV was any more real than wrestling, but this was just gross. 
      The company had an opportunity to use its brand to dispel the myth of the solo genius auteur inventor. Eli Whitney, Benjamin Franklin, ???, and Steve Jobs all had teams. Quirky promoted its online community of collaborators, printing their names on the packaging, but not the actual designers and engineers who made the ideas of the "inventors" possible
- As the media picked up the story and it became clearr that this was going to be a real thing, the source of my discomfort became my public profile on quirky's website
      much like any other social media profile: photo, location, bio, and The Numbers. every platform has those numbers on top — the ones that hook into your primal social instincts and keep you invested. The follower count. The tally of likes.
      On quirky, the big number was how much quirky had paid you in royalties. 
      There was no option to disable or obfuscate it. And why should there be: that number, which climbed higher with each passing quarter, was quirky's most effective marketing tool. But for me, it was a source of weird embarrasment. I'm certainly not the kind of person who would introduce themselves by stating my net worth. I was a college senior at an expensive school; everyone I knew was facing crushing student loan debt. I didn't want anyone to see me as someone who'd put that number as a source of pride. Someone whose value system had anything to do with the value in their bank account. But there it was, at the top of my google search results. One day I noted with icky dismay that when you put my name into that search box, the first suggested query was "jake zien net worth". What the hell? 
      Before long, there were times when, meeting new people, I could tell they had already seen the number — something in their expression, a twitch around the eyes that seemed to carry judgement. 
      I asked many times for the company to give me the option to hide the number, or make it more general. Yknow, like mcdonalds: "thousands and thousands sold". It'd be tacky if they were still counting burgers, right?
      I wrestled with the 
- Making things worse was the company's cantankerous, boyish founder and CEO, whose founding story sprung from his own inevention, a way to secret headphones inside your hoodie at the back of a high school classroom. 
      With me, he played a role something like a warm-hearted but _____ older brother: an arm around the shoulder, but a vague sense of threat. I owe him enormously, and respect his vision, enthusiasm, and drive. But I also saw his callous disregard for social graces, his lavish spending, his boundless energy that wouldn't be boxed in by social graces, profit to loss ratios, or _____. He wore his unprofessionalism on his sleeve. 
      Pivot Power, wrapped in my story, was the rocket fuel that boosted Quirky to the exosphere of potential unicorns. On its back they raised its series B, then C, then D. They leased a gorgeous, enormous office in the corner of Chelsea that was just beginning to turn into the Big Money megaplex of Hudson Yards. They gut-remodeled the former warehouse loft, leaving in place the industrial-chic factory hardware that befitted the "maker spirit," but added hundreds of custom floor-to-ceiling glass panels to create conference rooms, meeting rooms, phone rooms, a prototyping lab outfitted with enormous 3D printers, a machine shop with multiaxis CNCs usually only found in China or Cupertino, and a huge open-plan workspace stuffed with enough Apple gear to rival the nearby flagship Apple Store Chelsea. There was a retail showroom for visitors, and at the center of it all, an enormous all-hands space filled with enough broadcast technology to create a cable news network. 
      From this stage they broadcast the weekly "Eval", which had metastasized from that 10 minutes at the card table into a 45 minute web show with colored lights, multiple cameras, and plenty of TV-ready action. Ben was the master of this carnival, which went live shortly after company happy hour began. Designers held plastic cups as they presented a handful of ideas from the community to Ben, his executives, and sometimes a guest star. With the internet watching the panel voted — and excitedly congratulated the ideators who passed. "You are now a Quirky Inventor!" To me, this didn't feel right. The message to the person on the other end of that congratulations was clear: you are going to have the same fate as Jake. But I knew the reality was different: all it meant was that their idea had made it to the starting line of the design process. There was no guarantee it would ever make it to manufacturing, and even if it did, it might not sell. I told Ben and other members of the leadership team that I thought it wasn't right to call these people Inventors until their products were for sure going to market — let Ideator be a crown, too, and don't get peoples' hopes up.
