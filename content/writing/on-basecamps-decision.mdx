- insulating work from political debate seems worthwhile, but it remains to be seen whether any space can truly be insulated from whatever's going on on Twitter 

- My experience with politics in the workplace

- The Build brand
      The team breathed life into this brand, the best possible outcome
      But the energy in that breath was the energy of early 2017 in NYC
      And the energy of a quirky team with a reactive, bratty streak, that had prided itself on diversity reacting to being acquired by a company that exuded corporate energy, and not just any kind â€” the bro-y energy of commercial real estate. one of the world's biggest, whitest, malest companies
      A civics channel cropped up on slack, but like all slack channels, it was hard to separate the discussion there from the rest
      committees were formed. Engagement, diversity, etc
      commendable things happened: people joined the corporate committees too, pushed for inclusivity in new ways
      The brand and its builder characters especially became about social activism 
      We welcomed this 
 
-  The biggest blowup in company history started with an engagement survey where someone complained about gossip
      I was out on vacation getting engaged, and when I returned I had planned to break the news on the engagement channel. But when I opened it I found the biggest drama bomb in our little company's 4-year history
            As I read through with the remove of not-realtime, it was like a script where everyone played their role
      Everyone freaked out thinking it was them, so whomever wrote it was clearly right
      Some asked for the company to not publish verbatim anonymized responses
      Response from leadership was poorly coordinated and muddled. The brusque founder who prided himself on seeing things in black and white prone to sharp edges and escalation  jumped right in to prove his rightness
      The one who never showed emotion responded by stating policy and facts, but it seemed insensitive
      The sensitive outspoken ones also prone to escalation escalated
      The discussion on slack sat festering 
      Hours later, after everyone had gone home, the sensitive outspoken voice jumped in to make their position, reigniting the fire
      Soon it was a strawman. Would we publish hate speech if someone wrote that?
      Yes, we would, argued the brusque one. We don't believe in censorship. Free speech is more important than your feelings. 
      The outspoken one just read, we don't care about your feelings, and we've taken a position on publishing hate speech.
      They never spoke again 

-  Adding pronouns to email signatures
      coming from the perspective of college recruiting, showed us as ahead of the curve
      but might rub some in the rest of the corporation the wrong way
            intentional education coming from us, the young knowledgeable group in america's most diverse city
      I personally bristled at this change. It felt weird. As far as I knew, we didn't have any trans folx in our recruiting pipeline. we had to add this just in case someone applied? My consciousness expansion, confronting a strand of something like bigotry in myself
            just plain don't like email signatures in the first place
            analogy to braille
            required nothing of me to potentially make another feel peace
            i designed the signatures

- Bathroom signs
      request to change the male female signs to gender neutral
      I was uncomfortable about this. 
            Same streak
            Our bathrooms were horrible
            Also just really private about the bathroom. Frankly, I don't think anyone should be subjected to being in a room with me while I'm taking a shit, and if I could save 40% of the office from that, I wanted to
      I expressed my hesitance to redo the signs. I suggested that perhaps the energy we were spending on this would be best use outside the office. The outspoken ones came down on me.
            I was not an active ally, as we had been taught to be at an informal happy hour all hands, but an all hands nonetheless
      I feel this is a more fundamental issue of bathroom design: toilet rooms + handwashing area
            Nevertheless
      I was learning. It's not about the hardware on the person, I said at a meeting, it's about the hardware in the restroom
            I felt this half-joke land with a thud
      I felt I was viewed with suspicion after this
            It absolutely bled into our teamwork
            I worked hard to reassure those I might have wronged and went out of my way to be friendly, but I never felt I could truly get back to neutral

- They fired everyone
      CBRE summarily ended the discussion on our behalf
      The CEO does send carefully-worded internal emails about political affairs unrelated to the business, but my guess is that these topics are generally avoided in the rest of the company, where denim pants were recently approved for wear on Fridays for non-client-contact positions

- In the end, the scorecard for political discussion at work isn't that pretty. Consciousnesses did expand, and people did learn, but at the cost of division that was never overcome, and which got in the way of teamwork, or at least was a sort of medium through which teamwork had to pass. Division between people who were ultimately in ideological agreement. Needless animosity between those who felt comfortable being outspoken and those who were less sure-footed about stepping into treacherous territory. Or even just preferred to keep work about work.
