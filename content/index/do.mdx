### Designing products
This is a very blurry term, but for me, it has included devising business strategy; researching, validating and defining ideas; leading interdisciplinary workshops; sketching, prototyping, and other UX methods; positioning and visual design; and more than anything, lots of communication and collaboration with others who think in different ways.

### Developing brands
This is when the the “product” being designed is a system that helps an organization precisely position itself in the minds of its audiences. The system clarifies the organization’s personality and purpose and expresses these through ideas, language, and visuals. The work is mostly research and communication with all kinds of people inside and outside of the organization.
