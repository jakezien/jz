### Create products
For me, this is mostly about communication and collaboration with others who think in different ways. It includes devising business strategy; researching, defining and validating ideas; leading interdisciplinary workshops; sketching, prototyping, and other UX methods; and positioning and visual design.

### Develop brands
This is product design too, but the product is a system of ideas and visuals that help an organization shape peoples' behavior.

### Communicate anything
I've been told, "communication is your superpower." In person or in writing, among friends or executives, one-on-one or before an audience, I work to be plainspoken and engaging, and I listen actively with an open mind. Others' attention is a privilege. I aim to reward it with well-chosen words, analogies that render complicated things as familiar ideas, storytelling that explains as it entertains, and a few solid jokes.
