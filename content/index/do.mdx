##### For me, design is a general skill to be applied broadly — I'm&nbsp;more a handyman than a plumber. Here are some of the things I've applied that skill to do.

### Design products
This is a blurry term, but for me, it has meant devising business strategy; researching, validating and defining ideas; leading interdisciplinary workshops; sketching, prototyping, and other UX methods; positioning and visual design; and more than anything, lots of communication and collaboration with others who think in different ways. 
  

### Develop brands
This is product design too, but the product is a system of ideas and visuals that help an organization shape peoples' behavior.

### Communicate anything
One colleague said, "as a designer, communication is your superpower." Whether in person or in writing; with friends or among executives; one-on-one or before an audience; I work to always make my message plainspoken and engaging, and to listen actively and with an open mind. Having others' attention is a privilege, so I aim to reward it with well-chosen words, analogies that make complicated things easy to understand, good storytelling that explains as it entertains, and, if I can work them in appropriately, a solid joke or two.
