## Things that I think
<div class='half-margin-bottom'>

##### I’m interested in consciousness and perception, behavior and communication, and generally why things are the way they are. And animals; I really love animals.

We're animals too, and we face interesting challenges that I think have more to do with our behavior as a species than as individuals.

I’d really like to help with these challenges. 

The way I know how to help is through design, which I think is a method for improving the way things are. Design works by studying things’ behavior, creating an intervention, measuring its effect, and iterating. Design marries the scientific method and the creative process. It's like us: both rational and inventive. I think that’s really cool.
