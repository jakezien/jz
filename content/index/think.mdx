## Things that I think
<div class='half-margin-bottom'>

##### I’m a design thinker, interested in consciousness & perception, behavior & communication, and generally why things are the way they are. And animals; I really love&nbsp;animals.

We're animals too, and our behavior creates difficult and interesting challenges. I'd really like to help us solve them.

I know how to help through design, which I think is a method for improving the way things are by changing behavior. It applies the scientific method to the creative process, and in that, I think it's like us: rational and reasoned, yet inspired and inventive.<br/>
I think that’s really cool.
