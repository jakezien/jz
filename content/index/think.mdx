## Things That I Think
I’m interested in consciousness and perception, behavior and communication, and generally why things are the way they are. And animals; I really love animals.

I think about how you and I comprise trillions of cells, each an individual living thing. And I think that we people, too, add up to a superorganism — that we are more interdependent every day, and that it’s what we all do, taken together, that gives rise to our biggest challenges.

I’d really like to help with these challenges. 

The way I know how to help is through design, which I think is a strategy for iteratively improving the way things are. Design applies the scientific method to the creative process, fusing our ability to reason and our inventive human spirit. I think that’s really cool.
