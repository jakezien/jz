 ## Things that I think
<div class='half-margin-bottom'>

<p class="bigText">I’m interested in consciousness, communication, and why things are the way they are. And animals; I really love&nbsp;animals.</p>

We’re animals too, and our behavior creates interesting problems. I’m here to pursue the problems that matter — to leave the place better than I found it.

I do this through design, a tool for shaping behavior. Design applies the scientific method to the creative process, and in that, it’s like us: rational and reasoned; inspired and inventive.

I think that’s really cool.
