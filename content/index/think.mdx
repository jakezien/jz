## Things That I Think
##### I’m interested in consciousness and perception, behavior and communication, and generally why things are the way they are. And animals; I really love animals.

I think about how you and I comprise trillions of cells, each an individual living thing. I think that we all add up to a superorganism too, and that it’s what we all do, taken together, that gives rise to our biggest challenges.

I’d really like to help with these challenges. 

The way I know how to help is through design, which I think is a strategy for iteratively improving the way things are. 
Design applies the scientific method to the creative process, fusing our ability to reason and our inventive human spirit. I think that’s really cool.
