 ## Things that I think
<div class='half-margin-bottom'>

<p class="bigText">I’m interested in consciousness, communication, and why things are the way they are. And animals; I really love&nbsp;animals.</p>

We’re animals too, and our behavior creates difficult, interesting problems. My life is about pursuing the problems that matter. I’m here to leave the place better than I found it — to provide better answers for that “why”. 

I do this through design, which I believe is a tool for shaping behavior. It applies the scientific method to the creative process, and in that, I think it’s like us: rational and reasoned, yet inspired and inventive.

I think that’s really cool.

##### What's the deal with this website?
I’d like my place on the Internet to transmit a fuller sense of me than the typical designer’s website. A portfolio answers the question, “what do you do?” This site intends to answer, “who are you?”
