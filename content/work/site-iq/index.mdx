## What it is
##### Site IQ gives commercial real estate teams a way to instantly generate the documents they need to communicate with every client, as well as a collaborative, online space to manage data about properties in their markets.

We discovered that each team had its own way of making these critical documents, cobbling email, spreadsheets, and PowerPoint templates, and leaving a patchy trail of copypasted data. Without a single, reliable source of truth, every team had to manually verify the same data again and again for each new document. Site IQ replaced this inefficient, error-prone process with a friendly, modern workflow built to keep data fresh and reliable.

## What I did
I was Design Lead on this project, collaborating with my Product, Tech, and Business counterparts to guide a team of seven engineers.
- Conducted research and interviews with broker teams and CBRE executives. We used the _Jobs to Be Done_ framework to determine the best problems to solve; then tested our solutions with them and iterated on the feedback.
- Communicated our vision and progress up, down, and sideways, and presented the product on stage at a conference of 600 brokers.
- Did all the design work: information architecture, workflow definition, feature flows, wireframes, prototypes, usability audits, and production UI; iterating and validating continuously with the team, users, and stakeholders.

## What went well
- We solved the problem we set out to solve for our users. They found enough immediate, durable value in Site IQ to rely on it for real, everyday business.
- We met the moment's business goal of helping teams be more efficient, but also correctly predicted and met the future business goal of empowering teams with data.
- When a reorg scythed our 60-person group down to 10 lucky individuals (including me), Site IQ was the only product among a dozen to survive. It became the foundation of a CEO-led, companywide effort to build a workflow platform for every team at CBRE.

## What I learned
- That an organization’s structure is a fundamental constraint on every project. It determines which strategies can succeed, and shapes any products or systems that result.
- The differences between classes of users, as well as customers, decisionmakers, and stakeholders, and how best to communicate the same information to each group.
- How to cultivate a lightweight, transparent design process that empowers engineers with context and is congruent with their workflow; and that design tools and workflows are evolving in the direction of git: collaborative, iterative, versioned.

## What I’d do differently next time
- Focus the work tightly on the most valuable thing — producing custom documents — and “outsource" the database stuff to an existing spreadsheet tool.
- Design our solution to be less self-contained and more workflow-agnostic.
- Approach the work not as product design, but service design: turn business stakeholders into teammates, and create new processes rather than new tools.
