## What it is
##### Myndy is a female-founded company that introduces the concept of _mental fitness_, positing that qualities like confidence, optimism, and resilience are not traits one must be born with, but mental "muscles” that can be trained and developed.
Myndy recognizes that positive inner habits are as critical to the mind as regular exercise is to the body. It offers women a uniquely practical framework for mental health, sharpening its blurry mysteries into a set of skills that can be built like any others, through focus and practice.
## What I did
Myndy’s founder hired me at a very early stage to collaborate directly and intensely with her in creating an identity for the company she left her job to build.
### Discovery & definition
- Led a series of workshops with the founder and her inner circle to explore  the huge, passion-filled, amorphous space of her concept; to discern its most important, unique features; and to crystallize those into a cogent, specific brand vision. Adapted rapid ideation and affinity mapping techniques for the fully-remote world of 2020.
- Developed several visual expressions of the brand with divergent styles and positionings, then tested these with diverse groups of women in multiple workshop-review sessions. I learned about their preconceptions of mental health and fitness, and recorded their raw feedback on the visuals.
- Fed that feedback into rounds of iteration with the founder until we landed on a concise metaphor and matching visual device: multicolored beads, each representing a moment or experience, together comprising an individual and her complex inner life.
### Delivery
- Built the bead idea into a visual language flexible enough to work in the classroom or the boardroom. The colorful dots could be an expressive blast or a quiet motif; could swarm into a mosaic, offering a consistent treatment for photography; and in one particular configuration, they could form the Myndy logo.
- Quickly developed and launched a teaser site that invites users to play with the beads, using Gatsby.js and a lightweight physics engine. Also set up a highly customized Squarespace site for the founder to build on (fighting its limitations and layout engine all the way).
- Delivered a logo, wordmark, color and type system; concise, actionable brand guidelines; templates for PowerPoint, business cards, and letterhead;  and a whole bunch of production-ready assets and bead art for use in slides, social media, print and the web.
## What went well
- Educated the founder and her  team about the identity process and design in general, creating durable value from the beginning in areas they didn’t even know existed 
- Helped the founder understand and distill her passion project into a clear hierarchy of crisp concepts
- Played a ton of roles, from workshop leader to user researcher to front-end developer to visual designer
- Visually, landed far from where we started, which feels like we really got to the heart of it
## What I learned
- I’m better at the early stages of the identity process — discovery, definition, workshopping, positioning, ideating — than the later, executional ones
- That I underestimate the complexity and time required of every step of the process
- That in close collaboration, communication and structure are extremely important
- That once the brand is figured out, producing all the work isn’t a cakewalk — it may take even longer than the definition work
## What I’d do differently next time
- Work with a partner to codevelop the visuals — grinding out the art is a timesuck I didn’t plan for
- More structure, more communication, etc
- Offer to do the defining and initial visuals and call that a complete project
