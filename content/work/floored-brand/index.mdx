## What it is

<p className="bigText"> In 2012, I was the first design hire at a nascent NYC startup in need of branding and UI. I grew that project into a full-time role, evolving the brand and its products as we pivoted from 4-person experiment to 45-person business to acquisition by CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate firm.</p>

### Lofty

<p className="bigText">The company I joined, then called Lofty, comprised three cofounders, one contract engineer, and an impressive tech demo: a 3D scan of a Manhattan apartment that you could explore, like a video game, in a web browser.</p>

The business plan was to digitize spaces with 3D scans, and to build a web platform for exploring them. The applications the company imagined ranged from interior design, architecture, and real estate to education, entertainment, and “travel.” 

Without a well-defined product or proven business model, creating a durable visual identity should have been difficult. But the shifty entropy of early startuphood was, oddly, a workable match for my “process” as an inexperienced designer, which consisted of drawing logos and “building out from there.” I iterated through dozens of Lofty logo concepts, collaborating with the founders to shape something unique, techy, consumer-friendly, and flexible enough to work for any of the myriad applications we envisioned. Oh, and it had to be purple; that was the founders’ only hard requirement.

After a couple weeks of drawing, hanging prints for critique, and iterating, we had a narrow enough set of ideas to hold a final vote. The founders chose as the official Lofty logo this concept, which played on the notion of "opening the door" to our online spaces.

From this logo I extrapolated a minimal brand (backwards from my process today!) — and produced a website, iPad app UI, and of course, t-shirts.

### Floored

<p className="bigText">Mere weeks after settling into our Lofty brand, legal trouble from an existing trademark forced us to scrap our work and find a new name. We became Floored, and I started playing with logos.</p>

I thought it’d be easy: change the Lofty logo to “Floored,” with the bonus of moving the F-door glyph to the front. But it didn’t work. Without other letters to introduce it, the symbol lost its “F-ness”, reading as an icon for a company called “Loored”. So I started over, iterating through 3D-inspired concepts with lots of flexibility.

More rounds of printouts and votes. The final Floored logo was a unanimous pick. Like a digital 3D model, it was made of triangles strategically arranged to create the illusion of depth on a 2D surface.

I designed a Floored website, then built it, learning the required tools as I went. These included Jekyll, 2012's static site generator _du jour_; three.js for 3D graphics; and gsap.js,for fancy animation.

### Acquisition by CBRE
After many pivots, pitches and cold calls, we hit an application for our technology: commercial real estate. The Floored brand was surprisingly at home in the boardrooms of corporate real estate giants, hungry to differentiate their properties in the crowded NYC market. Before long, “proptech” had emerged as a distinct category in startupworld, WeWork was starting to look like a a threat, and our customers showed interest in taking ownership of technology that could solve their differentiation problem. 

So on the last day of 2016, four years into our startup journey, Floored was acquired by CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate firm. I designed a new iteration of our brand — Floored, Powered by CBRE — to mark our evolution and reflect our new position.

This turned out to be folly: the acquisition terms required us to relinquish our identity and represent ourselves as CBRE. But it was a fun exercise that helped us prepare for our next chapter, and it set the stage for a much better project, [CBRE Build](/work/cbre-build). 

## What went well
This project forced me to generate countless ideas, keep a safe distance from my favorite ones, and continuously adapt to the evolving needs of a growing company. The result, a brand that was durable and flexible enough to attract both brainy new grads and besuited real estate executives, was a success. And my design process improved with each iteration; by the end, I had learned to proactively build a coalition of stakeholders; start with research including our employees and customers, and  present my final proposal to the whole company, educating them about the design process and what makes a good identity.

## What I learned
- identity design, interviewing, buliding foundation
- 
- 

## What I’d do differently next time
- insist that there is no need for a logo until there is a business plan and proven market
- work ahead iwth our acquirer to define our position w/r/t them rather than let them
