## What it is

<p className="bigText"> In 2012, I was the first design hire of a nascent NYC startup that needed help with branding and UI. I grew that project into a full-time role, evolving the brand and crafting interfaces as we pivoted our way from 4-person experiment to 45-person business, and ultimately to acquisition by CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate firm.</p>

## What I did

### Lofty

<p className="bigText">When I joined, the company, then called Lofty, comprised the three cofounders — two engineers and a business expert — one contract engineer, and a really cool tech demo: a 3D scan of a real apartment that you could explore, like a video game, entirely within a web browser.</p>

The plan was to use this brand-new 3D scanning technology to digitize interiors, and to build a web platform for publishing and exploring them. The applications, the company imagined, ranged from interior design and architecture to education and entertainment to real estate. I was a relatively inexperienced designer who hadn’t yet built a solid process for defining visual identity, instead overindexing on the primacy of the logo. But this proved a workable strategy for a startup environment where business plans and product concepts shifted constantly underfoot.

- Iterated through dozens of logo concepts for Lofty, working directly with the founders to help shape something that might work for any of the myriad applications we envisioned for the technology

- With a vote among the founders, we chose a final Lofty logo, inspired by "opening the door" to our online spaces.

- I extrapolated from this a minimal brand — quite backwards from how I'd do it today! — and produced a marketing website, some iPad app UI, and of course, t-shirts.

### Floored

<p className="bigText">After only weeks of settling into the Lofty brand, legal trouble from an existing trademark forced us to scrap what we had and start over. I helped the company through the process of finding its new name: Floored.</p>

- I began the logo design process again, iterating through many 3D-inspired concepts that might work for the broad range of applications we had in mind.

- After many rounds of printouts, votes, and refinement, we landed on a final Floored logo. Like a digital 3D model, the logo was bulit of triangles, strategically arranged to create the illusion of depth on a 2D surface.

- I designed a website to go with the new Floored logo and built it myself, learning the tools required as I went. These including Jekyll, 2012's static site generator _du jour_; and three.js and gsap.js, which provided 3D graphics and fancy animations.

### Acquisition by CBRE
- As we gradually found the application that suited our technology, we found ourselves in the boardrooms of corporate real estate giants. The core elements of the brand were durable enough to work in these situations
- Four years into our startup journey, several pivots and product iterations later, Floored was acuired by CBRE. I designed one last iteration of the brand to reflect the position we (briefly and incorrectly) thought we would have

## The outcome
- The floored brand was retired when we joined cbre, but its durable design was part of the propellant that put us in the position to do so
-
-

## What went well
- tons of ideas and adaptation to change
- worked with minimal underpinning to develop a strong mark that was durable enough to work for new grad applicatants and fortune 140 execs 
- from designing the lofty logo to the final iteration of floored, learned the fundamentals of identity design and how to do mroe than just make a logo
- ?

## What I learned
- identity design, interviewing, buliding foundation
- 
- 

## What I’d do differently next time
- insist that there is no need for a logo until there is a business plan and proven market
- work ahead iwth our acquirer to define our position w/r/t them rather than let them 
-
