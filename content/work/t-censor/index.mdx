## What it is
##### In a fit of pique sometime in 2017, exhausted by an inescapable name and repugnant visage, I stretched my front-end development skills to create a plugin that would provide a more peaceful browsing experience across the web.
Inspired by _Broad City_’s brilliant bleeping of his name, I realized the efficacy of this approach. We couldn’t do much until an election — but we could control one thing, which just happened to be the only thing he actually cares about. Ratings. Eyeballs. Hearing and seeing his own name; forcing himself on the world. Taking that away amounted to reclaiming some personal power — and it was a lot of snarky fun.
## What I did
I built and published a Chrome extension that, once installed, would find every instance of his name or face on any webpage and pixellate them out, just as TV news would do to something vulgar and unairable. Users could also see a count of how many times they had been spared reading the name or seeing the face.
- Learned several new developer tricks: training and using a client-side face-recognition API, using `canvas` to create the visual effect I wanted, efficiently parsing dynamic page content to find what I was looking for, and Chrome’s Extensions API
- Experimented with online anonymity, using Tor to handle all the online parts of the project, including registering a Google Developer account, a Twitter account, and a domain name without giving away any personal information
- Created a graphic identity and website to promote the plugin and half-heartedly tried to spread it on Twitter
## What went well
- The plugin worked satisfyingly and genuinely reduced my stress level when browsing the web for several years
- The project got a “like” on Twitter from the official Broad City account
- I felt re-empowered as a citizen of democracy, but also as a person able to turn a flash of inspiration into a fully realized project
## What I learned
- Many technical skills already listed above
- How difficult it is to use the internet today without giving up any personal information, the limit of my endurance for repeatedly proving I am Not A Robot, and how awful the web has become when scripts are disabled
- ?
## What I’d do differently next time
- Choose a more self-explanatory name for the project (I launched it under the name T-Chip, a reference to the TV-censoring V-Chips of the 80s, which no one understood)
- Work harder to promote the thing and see if it might actually get a solid user base
- Release an update in the runup to each election that replaced the pixellation effect with an image reading “VOTE” and the number of days until the election
