## What it is
<p className="bigText">Creating the world's first flexible power strip, a Red Dot Design award-winning product that sold over two million units, through the Quirky invention platform.</p>


## What I did
As a rising high school senior in summer 2006, I sketched a concept power strip that could extend to fit adapters of any size. I knew the idea had teeth. But I didn't know how to bring it to fruition — until I heard about Quirky, the startup “invention platform” that developed products from crowdsourced ideas. Bored in class in 2010, I paid $99 to submit “The Usable Power Strip”. It was the best hundred bucks I ever spent.

In the following months, I collaborated directly with Quirky's founder, designers, engineers, and online community as my concept made its way off the page and into reality. In under a year, my sketch became a shipping product, sold at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Home Depot. 

Quirky calls me Pivot Power's "inventor", but the credit for my idea's success belongs to the Quirky team. They evolved its form from telescope to snake, gave it its catchy name, electrical-engineered it, navigated manufacturing and regulatory approvals, and marketed it. I just sparked the idea.

## The outcome
Pivot Power launched in summer 2011 and immediately became Quirky's bestselling and best-known product, a status it has firmly held for ten years. It landed Quirky in the tech blogosphere and the pages of _Wired_, _Inc_, and the New York _Times_. Its promise earned Quirky distribution in big-box retail, including a flashy launch with Bed Bath & Beyond, where shoppers could find an entire Quirky aisle, complete with a tablet for submitting their ideas. Pivot Power was the fuel that rocketed Quirky from startup team of a couple dozen to potential unicorn with a staff of hundreds. Pivot Power even survived Quirky's 2015 bankruptcy in 2015, 

It spawned a family of spinoffs, including mini, rugged, and smarthome editions, and was the only Quirky product to be redesigned as a sleeker Power's launch in summer 2011 was covered by


## What went well

## What I learned

## What I’d do differently next time
Quirky’s online community responded enthusiastically, voting my concept into Idea Evaluation, a weekly event where Quirky staff chose ideas for further development. I tuned in to the livestream from Quirky’s office to watch the young CEO and his small staff judge my work. There was no debate: The Usable Power Strip was greenlit for prototyping, and I was named a Quirky Inventor. 

In the following months, emails and calls with Quirky staff turned into Amtrak tickets to New York. I was photographed for packaging and shown rapidly progressing prototypes. The staff and online community had evolved my idea’s form — a snake instead of a telescope — and given it a name: Pivot Power. Somewhere between my chest and my gut, a cautious excitement began to swell: *Holy shit, this is gonna be real.*

Six months after my submission, Pivot Power launched for presale on quirky.com. To my delight, the story landed in the pages of *Wired* and lit up the tech blogosphere. My photograph and story appeared in the *New York Times* — and the *Milwaukee Journal Sentinel*

Growing up I assumed the role of the family IT guy, which meant a lot of time spent fiddling with plugs under the computer desk. I generally found that the arrangement I wanted wasn’t possible because of an extra large transformer plug double parking on the outlet. “Damn,” I’d think, “I wish I could just stretch this thing and make em all fit.”

In 2006 I attended a precollege program at RISD for rising high school seniors. During this program my focus was Industrial Design, and for my final project I was to define, develop, model, and present a product concept. I still had my strechable power strip idea in my back pocket. 

Over the next year, I worked with a family friend who was a patent attorney to learn that my concept did indeed seem to be original. 

In 2007 I submitted my idea to a contest sponsored by NASA called Create the Future, in which I received honorable mention and a t shirt. 

In 2010, the family friend called to tell me about a company he’d read about in an article that purported to do exactly what I needed. The company, Quirky, accepted product ideas on its website from a community of aspiring “inventors,” who could then vote, offer feedback, and help shape each others’ products. The most popular would be chosen by Quirky for development, and the inventor and their collaborators would receive royalties on each unit sold. 

A week later I was bored in class and submitted my idea, _The Usable Power Strip_, to quirky.com. Within 10 days it had been chosen for development, and within a year it had launched not just at quirky.com, but in the pages of _Wired_, the tech and gadget blog ecosystem, and in Bed Bath and Beyonds across the country — including a flagship window display on 6th Avenue in Manhattan.

Pivot Power was Quirky’s best selling product until the day the company went bankrupt in 2015.
