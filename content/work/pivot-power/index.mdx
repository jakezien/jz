## What I did
As a rising high school senior in summer 2006, I sketched a concept power strip that could extend to fit adapters of any size.

            <GatsbyImage image={imageByName(props, 'power-strip-model', true)} alt="My very poorly made physical model of the power strip." />
      </div>

I knew the idea had teeth. But I didn't know how to bring it to fruition — until I heard about Quirky, the startup “invention platform” that developed products from crowdsourced ideas. Bored in class in 2010, I paid $99 to submit “The Usable Power Strip”. It was the best hundred bucks I ever spent.

</figure>

In the following months, I collaborated directly with Quirky's founder, designers, engineers, and online community as my concept made its way off the page and into reality. In under a year, my sketch became a shipping product, sold at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Home Depot. 

Quirky calls me Pivot Power's "inventor,” but the credit for my idea's success belongs to them, especially industrial designers Kate Vallon and Jordan Diatlo. The Quirky team evolved the form into the iconic snake, gave it its catchy name, worked out its challenging electrical engineering, navigated manufacturing and regulatory approvals, and marketed it. I just sparked the idea, and provided the story to test the business model.

## The outcome
Pivot Power launched in summer 2011 and immediately became Quirky's bestselling, best-known product, a status it has firmly held ever since. It landed Quirky (and me) in the pages of [_Wired_](https://www.wired.com/2010/06/quirky-jointed-power-strip-is-a-creative-outlet/), [_Inc_](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201310/josh-dean/is-quirky-the-worlds-most-creative-manufacturer.html), and the [New York _Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/technology/quirky-tests-the-crowd-based-creative-process.html), and across the tech [blogosphere](https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-29-community-developed-pivot-power-strip-now-available-to-order.html). Its promise earned Quirky distribution in big-box retail, including a flashy launch with Bed Bath & Beyond, where shoppers could find an entire Quirky aisle.

Pivot Power's success rocketed Quirky from a startup with a small team to a potential “unicorn” with a staff of hundreds. It spawned a family, including mini, rugged, and smarthome editions, and was the only Quirky product to be given a sleek "2.0" redesign. It even survived Quirky's 2015 bankruptcy. At a daylong auction of Quirky’s assets, Pivot Power generated a bidding war that proved it the most valuable item on offer. It was bought by Aliph Brands, who today sells Pivot Power through licensing to manufacturers.

## What I learned
My Quirky experience taught me about startups, investors, and intellectual property; that “hardware is hard,”; that proving a business model is harder; that a period of exuberant success can be shorter than the process of corporate bankruptcy. 

More than anything, it taught me the value of ideas relative to execution. Ideas are cheap; execution is everything. 

I was quite uncomfortable that Quirky promoted me as the sole “inventor” of a product made by a team — a team whose knowledge and effort far surpassed my own. So at every opportunity, I gave credit where due. I resisted the lesson that a modicum of work would reward me with praise, press, and success. But this poisonous dynamic, fed by the overwhelming response to Pivot Power, snuck tendrils through my defenses; I internalized the message in subtle, subconscious ways. And in the crucial first years of my career as a professional designer, the mismatch between expectation and reality stunted my growth.

The lasting value of Pivot Power has been realizing this — and uprooting it.
