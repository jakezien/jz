## What it is
<p className="bigText">Creating the world's first flexible power strip, a [Red Dot Design award-winning](http://red-dot-21.com/design/pivot-power/) product that sold over two million units, through the Quirky invention platform.</p>


## What I did
As a rising high school senior in summer 2006, I sketched a concept power strip that could extend to fit adapters of any size.

I knew the idea had teeth. But I didn't know how to bring it to fruition — until I heard about Quirky, the startup “invention platform” that developed products from crowdsourced ideas. Bored in class in 2010, I paid $99 to submit “The Usable Power Strip”. It was the best hundred bucks I ever spent.

In the following months, I collaborated directly with Quirky's founder, designers, engineers, and online community as my concept made its way off the page and into reality. In under a year, my sketch became a shipping product, sold at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Home Depot. 

Quirky calls me Pivot Power's "inventor,” but the credit for my idea's success belongs to the Quirky team. They evolved its telescoping form into the iconic snake, gave it its catchy name, worked out its challenging electrical engineering, navigated manufacturing and regulatory approvals, and marketed it. I just sparked the idea and lived the backstory that proved their business model.

## The outcome
Pivot Power launched in summer 2011 and immediately became Quirky's bestselling, best-known product, a status it has firmly held ever since. It landed Quirky (and me) in the pages of [_Wired_](http://www.wired.com/2011/08/quirky-inventions/), [_Inc_](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201310/josh-dean/is-quirky-the-worlds-most-creative-manufacturer.html
), and the [New York _Times_](), and across the tech [blogosphere](). Its promise earned Quirky distribution in big-box retail, including a flashy launch with Bed Bath & Beyond, where shoppers could find an entire Quirky aisle.

Pivot Power's success rocketed Quirky from a startup with a small team to a potential unicorn with a staff of hundreds. It spawned a family, including mini, rugged, and smarthome editions, and was the only Quirky product to be given a sleek "2.0" redesign. It even survived Quirky's 2015 bankruptcy. After a daylong bidding war that proved Pivot Power to be Quirky's most valuable asset, its intellectual property was sold to Aliph Brands. Pivot Power is still available today, licensed by Aliph and manufactured by Viatek.


## What I learned
My Quirky experience taught me about startups, investors, and intellectual property; that “hardware is hard,”; that a sustainable business model is hard to prove; that a period of exuberant success can be shorter than the process of corporate bankruptcy. More than anything, it taught me the value of ideas relative to execution: ideas are cheap; execution is everything. Being promoted as the “inventor” of a product made by a team whose knowledge and effort far surpassed my own made me deeply and immediately uncomfortable. At every opportunity I gave credit where due, and resisted learning that through a modicum of work, I would be rewarded with success, praise, and press. But this poisonous dynamic, fed by the overwhelming response to Pivot Power, snuck tendrils through my defenses. I internalized the message in subtle ways that stunted my early growth as a professional designer — and took years to notice and uproot. That was the biggest lesson.
