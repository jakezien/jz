## What it is
<p className="bigText">Creating a flexible power strip that sold over a million units through the Quirky invention platform.</p>


## What I did
In the summer of 2006, as a rising high school senior, I sketched a concept for a power strip that could extend to fit power adapters of all sizes. I knew the idea had teeth; for years it’d surface in my mind before sleep. But the path from concept to real thing was unknowable — until I heard about Quirky, a startup “invention platform” that developed products from crowdsourced ideas. Bored in class in 2010, I paid $99 to submit “The Usable Power Strip” to Quirky. It was the best hundred bucks I ever spent.

## The outcome
Quirky’s online community responded enthusiastically, voting my concept into Idea Evaluation, a weekly event where Quirky staff chose ideas for further development. I tuned in to the livestream from Quirky’s office to watch the young CEO and his small staff judge my work. There was no debate: The Usable Power Strip was greenlit for prototyping, and I was named a Quirky Inventor. 

In the following months, emails and calls with Quirky staff turned into Amtrak tickets to New York. I was photographed for packaging and shown rapidly progressing prototypes. The staff and online community had evolved my idea’s form — a snake instead of a telescope — and given it a name: Pivot Power. Somewhere between my chest and my gut, a cautious excitement began to swell: *Holy shit, this is gonna be real.*

Six months after my submission, Pivot Power launched for presale on quirky.com. To my delight, the story landed in the pages of *Wired* and lit up the tech blogosphere. My photograph and story appeared in the *New York Times* — and the *Milwaukee Journal Sentinel*



## What went well

## What I learned

## What I’d do differently next time

Growing up I assumed the role of the family IT guy, which meant a lot of time spent fiddling with plugs under the computer desk. I generally found that the arrangement I wanted wasn’t possible because of an extra large transformer plug double parking on the outlet. “Damn,” I’d think, “I wish I could just stretch this thing and make em all fit.”

In 2006 I attended a precollege program at RISD for rising high school seniors. During this program my focus was Industrial Design, and for my final project I was to define, develop, model, and present a product concept. I still had my strechable power strip idea in my back pocket. 

Over the next year, I worked with a family friend who was a patent attorney to learn that my concept did indeed seem to be original. 

In 2007 I submitted my idea to a contest sponsored by NASA called Create the Future, in which I received honorable mention and a t shirt. 

In 2010, the family friend called to tell me about a company he’d read about in an article that purported to do exactly what I needed. The company, Quirky, accepted product ideas on its website from a community of aspiring “inventors,” who could then vote, offer feedback, and help shape each others’ products. The most popular would be chosen by Quirky for development, and the inventor and their collaborators would receive royalties on each unit sold. 

A week later I was bored in class and submitted my idea, _The Usable Power Strip_, to quirky.com. Within 10 days it had been chosen for development, and within a year it had launched not just at quirky.com, but in the pages of _Wired_, the tech and gadget blog ecosystem, and in Bed Bath and Beyonds across the country — including a flagship window display on 6th Avenue in Manhattan.

Pivot Power was Quirky’s best selling product until the day the company went bankrupt in 2015.
