<p className="bigText">Creating a flexible power strip that sold over a million units through the Quirky invention platform.</p>

Growing up I assumed the role of the family IT guy, which meant a lot of time spent fiddling with plugs under the computer desk. I generally found that the arrangement I wanted wasn’t possible because of an extra large transformer plug double parking on the outlet. “Damn,” I’d think, “I wish I could just stretch this thing and make em all fit.”

In 2006 I attended a precollege program at RISD for rising high school seniors. During this program my focus was Industrial Design, and for my final project I was to define, develop, model, and present a product concept. I still had my strechable power strip idea in my back pocket. 

Over the next year, I worked with a family friend who was a patent attorney to learn that my concept did indeed seem to be original. 

In 2007 I submitted my idea to a contest sponsored by NASA called Create the Future, in which I received honorable mention and a t shirt. 

In 2010, the family friend called to tell me about a company he’d read about in an article that purported to do exactly what I needed. The company, Quirky, accepted product ideas on its website from a community of aspiring “inventors,” who could then vote, offer feedback, and help shape each others’ products. The most popular would be chosen by Quirky for development, and the inventor and their collaborators would receive royalties on each unit sold. 

A week later I was bored in class and submitted my idea, _The Usable Power Strip_, to quirky.com. Within 10 days it had been chosen for development, and within a year it had launched not just at quirky.com, but in the pages of _Wired_, the tech and gadget blog ecosystem, and in Bed Bath and Beyonds across the country — including a flagship window display on 6th Avenue in Manhattan.

Pivot Power was Quirky’s best selling product until the day the company went bankrupt in 2015.
