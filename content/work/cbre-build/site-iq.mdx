# Site IQ

Defining, designing, and coleading a team to build a modern workflow tool for commercial real estate brokers.

# How this project came about

- Product discovery, definition and development.
- Started with a prompt to create value for cbre's industrial line of business. Build on a past experiment, Dimension, that showed the users wanted tech in their workflow.
- Spent time in the markets, learning the people, their jobs, the problems. Brokers and staff.
- JTBD technique and analysis to identify what mattered. Defended this to stakeholders when it didn't match their initial view.
- Rapid iteration on product concept and workflow. Whiteboarding, user interviews at a regular cadence.
- Also, regular checkins with business stakeholders, and partnership with a biz rep who was on our team.
- Produced specs and design docs for engineers to build the thing.
- Helped transition the team from building to reacting to user feedback.
- Evolved team design process from a library of screens to a lightweight workflow integrated with eng tickets and pull requests.
- Fully owned user experience, workflow, UI of the product.
- Testimonials from real users.
- KPIs and accolades from business. Whitley / Chris quotes.
- Successfully predicted business priorities: data, integrated workflow. 
- The only product of 10 that produced enough real value to survive a reorg. Became the basis for a new platform.
