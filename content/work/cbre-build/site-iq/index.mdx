#### Defining, designing, and coleading a team to build a modern workflow tool for industrial real estate broker teams.

## How this project came about
CBRE’s industrial brokers — the ones who work on those big warehouses and plants on the side of the highway — had asked for better technology to help them do their jobs. CBRE’s president of industrial real estate chose CBRE Byukd NYC-based software innovation team, to answer this call. When the project began, the prompt was to improve on an existing third-party mapping application that brokers found too complex to be helpful in their hectic work lives.

## What I did
The project began when I and a newly-hired Product Manager were assigned to expand on the prompt above. We spent a quarter discovering and defining: reviewing the existing application, building relationships with Industrial executives and broker teams and conducting interviews with they and their clients. We followed the Jobs to Be Done framework, which revealed the most frustrating and inefficient parts of the teams’ workflows.

We learned that though cool mapping tools were important, the teams had more immediate needs: they were drowning in the daily administrivia of simply producing client-ready documents to explain the real estate search process. The PM and I, now joined by our Tech Lead, rapidly iterated on workflow diagrams, soon progressing to wireframes that we validated with our interviewees. Now we had a product vision we could communicate to our stakeholders.

With the business bought in, our team was staffed with engineers and we switched from definition to execution. My role changed from visioneer to tactician: coleading a team of engineers to understand the user context and product vision, and to implement features at a granular level.
