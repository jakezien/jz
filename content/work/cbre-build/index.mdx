## What it is
##### When Floored, the startup I’d helped build for 4 years, was acquired by CBRE, the world’s biggest commercial real estate firm, we faced an identity crisis. 
Our techy team, office, and culture were unchanged, but we had to let go of our name, logo, and visual brand — and with them went our recruiting power, as well as our group's sense of self. I recognized this unmooring as an identity problem, and initiated a project to create a new identity that would position us within our new parent company, clarifying our purpose for CBRE and for ourselves.

## What I did
- **Pitched the brand in a one-on-one session with CEO Bob Sulentic,** who approved the work enthusiastically, including special praise for my presentation skill, storytelling and slides.

- Interviewed dozens of people across CBRE and the globe — including brokers, IT professionals, managers, makers of maps and presentations, C-level executives, and tech recruits who rejected our offers — to learn what makes CBRE unique, its values, and its point of view on technology.
- Led by the research, I chose _build_ as the center of the new identity. It’s a word common to the worlds of real estate and technology: both kinds of developers go to work every day to build something. 
- Working with CBRE’s global heads of marketing and technology, I iterated on visual concepts that fused elements of real estate and tech, extending CBRE’s existing brand and values for a new audience.
- Created a unique and extensible illustration style and personally vector-drew at least a hundred hours’ worth of characters, icons, and one incredibly complicated pattern.
- Worked with architects, signmakers, contractors, print shops, and our own developers to bring the brand to life as environmental graphics, room signage, a new website, countless swag items, and convention booths.
## What went well
- The new identity did its job: it positioned us within CBRE as a software innovation lab, not an IT department; it galvanized our team as mission-driven technologists with a big opportunity to make change in a corporate environment; and it gave CBRE a voice that to communicate that opportunity to recruits, who responded with excitement CBRE had never previously been able to stir up.
- Got written up positively on _Brand New_, the design world’s foremost branding blog, and checking off a personal bucket list item.
- The brand took on a life of its own, spreading as technologists across the company breathed their spirit into the identity. Before long, you could find Build in Dallas, Seattle, and even India; and in media as varied as papercraft, 3D printing, and even crochet.
## What I learned
- That discussing the problems you’re solving for with a diverse group of interviewees yields a cheat sheet for the final pitch. When you know how each stakeholder thinks about the problem, it’s easy to communicate the design as a thoughtful solution built from their input, rather than a blob of creative voodoo.
- The power of discovery interviews to “socialize” new ideas, find hidden stakeholders, build a coalition, and create enthusiasm and momentum for a project.
- That educating the client about design interests them, helps them understand its value, and pulls them into the project. For example, explaining that graphic design's goal is not to "make it look pretty," but to manage communication and perception, elevates the conversation and the quality of the feedback.
- I purposefully made the visuals as crazy as possible from the get-go, figuring that the project would inevitably be canned, so I might as well have fun with it. But my enthusiasm shone through the work, which I think helped buoy it to success. It taught me that lightness of spirit is a key ingredient for success.
## What I’d do differently next time
- I’d learn more about organizational structure our team fit into, and design the brand to reflect that, instead of myopically crafting a solution to our little group’s problems.
- I’d work with CBRE leadership to determine Build's relationship to the rest of CBRE’s tech teams, creating a change management plan that would help the brand spread in an organized, sustainable way. 
- I’d take a less auteurish approach, building a bigger team to tackle the huge volume of execution work on illustrations, guidelines, and documents.
