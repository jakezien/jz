<p class="bigText">A sampling of volunteer graphic design projects I've completed for organizations that support scientific study of psychedelic compounds and sensible policy reform.</p>

### Stickers
A whole bunch ideas for stickers, buttons and patches to be used as promotional giveaways at MAPS conferences and events.

### Conference Identity
Visual identity concepts for MAPS' triannual Psychedelic Science Conference in California, where scientists and doctors from institutions like Johns Hopkins, NYU, and Oxford gather to present the latest findings in medical research into psychedelic compounds.

<figcaption>This was the existing visual material MAPS had developed for its conference. The new directions I developed sought to refine and evolve these graphics while referencing the same ideas.</figcaption>

### Social Media Campaign
A campaign to promote MAPS "Global Psychedelic Dinners", where donors host simultaneous dinner symposia to discuss and fundraise MAPS' FDA-approved study of MDMA as a therapy for PTSD. I came up with the idea for this campaign, and the graphics to support it.

### Event Poster
A short-notice, quick-deadline poster I created for a MAPS-sponsored workshop at University of Southern California.
