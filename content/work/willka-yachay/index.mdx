## What it is
<p className="bigText"> I volunteered to develop the visual identity and website for Willka Yachay, a nonprofit that supports Q’eros, an indigenous Incan community in Peru’s Andean mountains.</p>

Through the determination of its founder, Hannah Rae Porst, and a grant from Davis Projects for Peace, Willka Yachay has empowered Q’eros to build their first-ever school system and develop a unique curriculum. The lessons both preserve Incan culture and fortify it with skills necessary for the world beyond the mountains.

Here’s a succinct description from [Projects for Peace](https://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/projects/projects/node/1583): 
> Hannah Porst studied abroad in Peru during her junior year at Bates, and while there she visited the remote Andean community of Ch’allmachimpana. When she was leaving, she asked her hosts how she could thank them for their hospitality. After some initial conversation about soccer shoes or similar contributions, the villagers told Hannah that they really needed a school. While the region is recognized for strong indigenous traditions, elders were worried that their children were not well prepared for the modern world that is all too quickly approaching. They were afraid the children were easy prey for exploitation if they ventured beyond the mountain villages.\

> Hannah returned to Bates and started to brainstorm and to fundraise. Before the Projects for Peace grant was made, she had already raised enough money to begin the school in temporary quarters. The Projects for Peace award made construction of an actual school possible, and building was completed over the summer. Members of the community were responsible for curriculum design and all aspects of building the school, from acquiring the materials to thatching the roof. A certified bilingual teacher was hired to teach the children to read and write in Quechua, their native tongue, and in Spanish. The goal is to enable the students to be part of the outside world while at the same time to preserve and nurture their cultural heritage and traditions.
