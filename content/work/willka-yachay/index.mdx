## What it is
<p className="bigText"> I volunteered to develop the visual identity and website for Willka Yachay, a nonprofit organization that supports Q’eros, a community of indigenous Inkans in the mountains of Peru.</p>

Willka Yachay collaborated with Q’eros to build the region’s first school system and develop its unique curriculum. The lessons preserve Inman culture and fortify it with skills necessary for the world beyond the mountains.

WY's founder, Hannah Ray Porst, started the organization as a college project and has continued it as her life's work as an adult. I was inspired by her dedication, my own visits to Peru, and the incredible photographs and video she brought from Q’eros. I couldn’t let this treasure trove fall into the hands of another designer.
