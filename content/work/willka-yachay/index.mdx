## What it is
<p className="bigText"> I volunteered to develop the visual identity and website for Willka Yachay, a nonprofit that supports Q’eros, an indigenous Incan community in Peru’s Andean mountains.</p>

Willka Yachay has empowered Q’eros to build their first-ever school system and develop a unique curriculum that both preserves Incan culture and fortifies it with skills necessary for the world beyond the mountains.

I’ve paraphrased the project’s description from [Projects for Peace](https://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/projects/projects/node/1583): 
> During her junior year at Bates, [Willka Yachay founder] Hannah Porst studied abroad in Peru, visiting the remote Andean community of Ch’allmachimpana. Upon leaving, she asked her hosts how she could thank them for their hospitality. After conversation about soccer shoes or similar contributions, the villagers told Hannah that what they really needed was a school. The elders worried that their children were not prepared for the quickly approaching modern world, making them easy prey for exploitation.
> 
> Hannah returned to Bates to brainstorm and fundraise. She had collected enough to begin a school in temporary quarters when she was awarded a Projects for Peace grant, making possible the construction of a permanent school building. The Andean community were responsible for all aspects of building the school, from acquiring the materials and thatching the roof to designing the curriculum.

My involvement began with a logo for Ch’allma School, the first building completed in Q’eros. In drawing the letters, I took inspiration from the construction’s wooden timbers, the childrens’ chalkboard letters, and the hand-painted lettering I had seen everywhere on my own visits to Peru. I set the type on a traditional handwoven textile made by Q’eros artisans.

After Hannah graduated, she founded Willka Yachay to expand the work she had begun in college. With the new name and broadened scope came a need for an fuller visual identity and an online  presence. I expanded the visual vocabulary with a color palette drawn from the village’s mountaintop landscape and its signature weavings, and a pair of typefaces that reflected the coexistence of tradition with modernity.

In 2012, I designed the first Willka Yachay website and stretched my beginner’s knowledge of web development to hack it together. The result was like a Q’eros weaving: uniquely handmade. The content and strucure were warp and weft, inextricable, impossible to edit or build upon.

Willka Yachay’s website had to keep pace with its growing impact, reconition, and ambition. In 2014, we launched a redesigned site rebuilt from scratch. My visual and developer skills had improved — this time, the design goal was to get out of the way of Hannah’s incredible photographs and video from Q’eros. I art directed this trove of hundreds of images and hours of video, selecting highlights and editing together short clips. And I built the site with a modern open-source toolkit, trying my best to separate the content from the engineering.

## The outcome
Willka Yachay’s website helped establish its legitimacy in the nonprofit community, and was instrumental in attracting serious partners such as ______.

The website’s success inspired us to add an online shop where Q’eros could sell their weavings directly to Western consumers.

The website has also given Willka Yachay a space to experiment with new offerings, like volunteer expeditions into the mountains, which have become the focus of the foundation’s practice. 

As of this writing, I am once again rebuilding the website to to reflect Willka Yachay’s new focus. And once again, I’m a better developer — this time, the content and code will be fully separate, so Hannah’s team can edit the site as needed, and bring in other engineers without fear that they’ll have to rip apart my “weaving” to contribute.

## What I learned
- How to build a highly customized website using a static site generator.
- How not to build a website: by handwriting HTML and "weaving" the content and styling directly into the structure and styling.
- How not to publish and maintain a website: by manually dragging over files via FTP. 
- How to use the web development tools _du jour_ of the mid 2010s: Jekyll, backbone.js, Browserify, and Node.
- How to create the snazzy Javascript-driven animations I had seen on agency-produced websites.

## What I’d do differently next time
What I’m doing this time: working with the Willka Yachay team to ensure that this latest version of the site is well-structured enough to be updated without my intervention.
And maybe try to get the project recognized on Site of The Day, or something like that.
