<p className="bigText">Visit the Willka Yachay <a href='http://www.willkayachay.org'>website</a>, which I designed, built, and art directed.</p>

<p className="bigText">This page is unfinished. More content coming soon.</p>

## What it is
<p className="bigText"> I volunteered to develop the visual identity and website for Willka Yachay, a nonprofit organization that supports Q’eros, a community of indigenous Inkans in the mountains of Peru.</p>

Willka Yachay collaborated with Q’eros to build the region’s first school system and develop its unique curriculum. The lessons preserve Inkan culture and fortify it with skills necessary for the world beyond the mountains.

WY's founder, Hannah Ray Porst, started the organization as a college project and has continued it as her life's work as an adult. I was inspired by her dedication, my own visits to Peru, and the incredible photographs and video she brought from Q’eros. I couldn’t let this treasure trove fall into the hands of another designer.

## What I did
The project began as a logo for Ch’allma School, the first iteration of Hannah's volunteer work. I drew the letters inspired by the wooden structures I observed in the photography, the chalkboard letters children's schools, and the lettering I had observed painted on signs and streets in Peru myself.

In 2012, I built a website that, like the weavings of the Petro people, was truly done by hand. This website for summer school served in his college project needs.

After college, Hanna build a team and founded will be at J to continue this work, and a new identity and expanded web presence we needed. We partnered again to do this work.
I developed I will be at a logo by expanding vocabulary I had developed virtual school.

The new identity system included a color palette drawn from the Katula mountaintop landscape, as well as the vibrant color of their signature weavings.

In 2014, we launched it will say yeah check website, another site I built by hand, but this time using a more modern to look at. The site was inspired by the best documentaries, and intended to frame and highlight the incredible contents of Hanna's photo and video without distracting.

I also served as photo and video editor for the project, oh when oh wing hundreds of pictures and hours of video into short clips for use on the side

## The outcome
Looking at his website helped establish it as a legitimate presence in the nonprofit community and was instrumental in attracting serious partners such as blank.
The website success inspired us to add an additional section where in the Quechua people could sell their wings directly to Western consumers.
The website also serves as a launching pad for Will Calle to experiment with offering expeditions into the mountains for those who wish to volunteer in the community, which has now become the focus of the foundations practice.
as of this writing, I am re-developing the WY website again, using a modern tool kit that will be familiar to any web developer, rather than a hand created textile legible only to me. This will help expand the team further and persist WY's mission into the future. It will also help refocus the site around WY's current mission, which is more about expectations than building schools.

## What went well
The site serves as well KJ's primary face to the world, and continues to do so very well.
use some of the content above

## What I learned
how to build a highly stylized website using a static side generator.
how not to build a website: by hand writing HTML and "weaving "the continent directly into the structure and styling.
how do you use see web development tools Dijour of the mid 2010s: Jekyll, browser at five, no JS
How not to publish and maintain a website: I manually drag in files via FTP
How to achieve this snazzy animations I had seen on so many agency produce websites using green sock animation platform and JavaScript

## What I’d do differently next time
what I am doing this time: working with the WITM to ensure that the latest version of the site can be updated without my intervention by separating the contents from the styling,
either document my decisions well encode, or use a headless CMS like contact for to serve contact to the site
maybe try to submit the website to side of the day or something like that

Kathryn W Davis Projects for Peace
The Ch’allma School Project

Hannah Porst studied abroad in Peru during her junior year at Bates, and while there she visited the remote Andean community of Ch’allmachimpana. When she was leaving, she asked her hosts how she could thank them for their hospitality. After some initial conversation about soccer shoes or similar contributions, the villagers told Hannah that they really needed a school. While the region is recognized for strong indigenous traditions, elders were worried that their children were not well prepared for the modern world that is all too quickly approaching. They were afraid the children were easy prey for exploitation if they ventured beyond the mountain villages.

Hannah returned to Bates and started to brainstorm and to fundraise. Before the Projects for Peace grant was made, she had already raised enough money to begin the school in temporary quarters. The Projects for Peace award made construction of an actual school possible, and building was completed over the summer. Members of the community were responsible for curriculum design and all aspects of building the school, from acquiring the materials to thatching the roof. A certified bilingual teacher was hired to teach the children to read and write in Quechua, their native tongue, and in Spanish. The goal is to enable the students to be part of the outside world while at the same time to preserve and nurture their cultural heritage and traditions.
