## What it is
<p class="bigText"> Myndy is a female-founded company that introduces the concept of _mental fitness_, positing that qualities like confidence, optimism, and resilience are not traits one must be born with, but mental "muscles” that can be trained and developed.</p>
Myndy recognizes that positive inner habits are as critical to the mind as regular exercise is to the body. It offers women a uniquely practical framework for mental health, sharpening its blurry mysteries into a set of skills that can be built like any others, through focus and practice.

## What I did
Myndy’s founder hired me at a very early stage to collaborate directly and intensely with her in creating an identity for the company she left her job to build.
### Discovery & definition
- Led a series of workshops with the founder and her inner circle to explore the huge, passion-filled, amorphous space of her concept; to discern its most important, unique features; and to crystallize those into a cogent, specific brand vision. Adapted rapid ideation and affinity mapping techniques for the fully-remote world of 2020.

- Developed several visual expressions of the brand with divergent styles and positionings, then tested these with diverse groups of women in multiple workshop-review sessions. I learned about their preconceptions of mental health and fitness, and recorded their raw feedback on the visuals.

- Fed that feedback into rounds of iteration with the founder until we landed on a concise metaphor and matching visual device: multicolored beads, each representing a moment or experience, together comprising an individual and her complex inner life.

### Delivery
- Built the bead idea into a visual language flexible enough to work in the classroom or the boardroom. The colorful dots could be an expressive blast or a quiet motif; could swarm into a mosaic, offering a consistent treatment for photography; and in one particular configuration, they could form the Myndy logo.

- Quickly developed and launched a teaser site that invites users to play with the beads, using Gatsby.js and a lightweight physics engine. Also set up a highly customized Squarespace site for the founder to build on (fighting its limitations and layout engine all the way).
- Delivered a logo, wordmark, color and type system; concise, actionable brand guidelines; templates for PowerPoint, business cards, and letterhead;  and a whole bunch of production-ready assets and bead art for use in slides, social media, print and the web.

## What went well
- The research phase of the project, especially the early co-design workshops, had the side effect of educating the founder and her team about the identity process and design in general, creating durable value in areas they hadn’t considered “designable”
- Helped the founder distill her passion project into a crisp hierarchy of clear concepts
- Met the project’s breadth by playing myriad roles, including workshop leader, user researcher, front-end developer, and visual designer
- The visual identity landed far from the early concepts, suggesting that we got to the heart of the problem
## What I learned
- I have better endurance for the early stages of the identity process — discovery, definition, workshopping, positioning, ideating — than the later, executional ones
- That I tend to underestimate the complexity and time required of every step of the design process
- The closer the collaboration, the more important the structure of communication
- That once the brand is figured out, producing all the work isn’t a cakewalk — it may take even longer than the definition work
## What I’d do differently next time
- Recognize that defining the brand and producing initial visuals is itself a complete project, and be ok with that
- Work with a partner to codevelop the visuals and halve the time needed to produce the art
- Create a structure that breaks the nebulous, unbounded design work down into the smallest, most communicable chunks, and stick to it
