Straight out of college, I was the first design hire at this NYC-based social media startup. (In a savvy move by Stampedâ€™s founders, I was quickly paired with a manager/mentor, a designer with a decade of experience at Google and Apple.) Our app had a great idea and a unique, typographically-driven, ahead-of-its time UI. Justin Bieber was an early user, John Gruber wrote approvingly of our launch, and after less than 2 years, the company found a $10m exit in an acqui-hire by Yahoo.
