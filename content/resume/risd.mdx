I took advantage of the two schools’ cross registration policy to supplement my RISD graphic design education with computer science classes at Brown. My thesis project, Points, imagined a future where design software shed its painterly roots in favor of tools and workflows more appropriate to screen design. (This future is now playing out in Sketch and Figma.) Honors included a faculty award for my thesis project, personal invitation to dine at the home of RISD’s president, and ____________.
