I was the second employee of this startup. Hired initially as a contract UI designer to make a logo and website, I grew the role to a full time product design position, stumbling often and learning UX fundamentals on the fly.  For the first two years, I was the company’s only design or product person. I led the design for Floored’s two products, web apps for 3D real estate tours and floor planning. 
Challenges of designing for a tough user and coming into the design process too late.
