I initiated and led a project to create a new brand identity for our new team at CBRE. When our startup, Floored, was acquired by the Big Green Machine, we sacrificed our name and logo — and with them, our ability to recruit NYC’s best technologists. To me, this was a branding issue, so I developed a new visual, verbal, and cultural identity that defined our group’s position and role to our new parent company — and to our existing team. I collaborated with CBRE’s Global Marketing Team, culminating in a final, one-on-one pitch to CBRE CEO Bob Sulentic, who received it with warm enthusiasm and a big thumbs up. The project was featured on Brand New. Events, swag, recruiting success.

Also at CBRE Build, I co-led a team to develop Site IQ, a application built from the ground up. 

Also touched half a dozen other products.
