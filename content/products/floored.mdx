#### Designing interactions for 3D real estate software on the web.

// TODO: biz context or biz value of these designs. what i learned on the project. what i messed up or would do differently.

## Floored 3D
I designed the UI for Floored’s first application, a 3D experience for real estate tours that anticipated today’s need to visit spaces remotely. The app was unique for its ability to deliver videogamelike interactive 3D tours right on a webpage, a technical feat made possible by WebGL, then a new feature of the web, and a very hardworking team of in-house 3D artists. 
The design challenge was to create a UI and navigation scheme built not for gamers, but for everyday, non-techie users. This UI had to make 3D navigation easy for first-timers who might be using a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen, all 2D methods of input. And the UI also bore the task of explaining that interactive 3D stuff was now something that could appear when you click on a web link.

## Floored 3D Editor
The 3D environments users explore in Floored 3D are built, lit, decorated and surfaced by talented in-house Floored artists working in the web-based Floored 3D Editor. This app provides the pro backend to the front of house show: project and asset management and a suite of 3D tools for creating and publishing environments. Building its UI meant engaging deeply with the team of artists, understanding their existing tools and workflow, and working together to place the border between industry standard desktop tools and Floored web software. 


## Floored Plans
Plans, another product with a service component, ingested architectural floorplans and put them online as interactive sandboxes for space and organization planning. Users can break up the floor as they like, experiment with different configurations and densities, and see how they affect important numbers: headcount, square foot per person, ratio of personal to communal space, and so on. Users can also explore their plans in 3D and share them easily with others.
