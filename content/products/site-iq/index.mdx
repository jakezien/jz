## What it is
Site IQ is a web app that gives commercial real estate teams a collaborative, online space to manage data about properties in their markets, then use that data to instantly create the client-facing documents they need for every job.

These teams, we discovered, make these critical documents through a workflow cobbled from email, spreadsheets, and PowerPoint templates, leaving a patchy trail of copypasted data. That means starting from scratch with every job, manually verifying the same data again and again. Site IQ replaces this inefficient, error-prone process with a friendly, modern tool.

## What I did
I was design lead on this project, meaning I worked with my Product and Tech counterparts to define the product; iterate on it and validate it; communicate about it up, down, and sideways; and guide a team of seven engineers to build it.
  - Conducted research with broker teams and CBRE executives, using the Jobs to Be Done framework to determine the best problems to solve; then tested our solutions with them and iterated on the feedback.
  - Presented the product on stage at a conference of 600 brokers.
  - Did all the design work: information architecture, workflow definition wireframes, prototypes, and production UI; all continuously iterated on and validated with users, stakeholders, and my team.

## What went well
  - We solved the problem we set out to solve for our users, who found enough immediate, durable value in Site IQ to use it for real, everyday business.
  - We met the moment's business goal of helping teams be more efficient, but also correctly predicted and met the next business goal of empowering teams through data.
  - When a reorg-layoff ended dozens of projects and scythed our 60-person team to 10 — including me — Site IQ was the only surviving product, becoming the foundation of a companywide initiative to build a workflow platform for every team at CBRE.

## What I learned
  - The difference between users, customers, and decisionmakers, and how to communicate the same ideas to each.
  - That an organization’s structure is a fundamental constraint that shapes every project and any resulting products or systems.
  - How to empower an engineering team with knowledge of the user and business contexts that determine what they’re building.
  - How to cultivate a lightweight, transparent design process that is congruent with engineers’ workflow, and that designers’ tools and workflows are evolving in the direction of git: collaborative, iterative, versioned.
    
## What I’d do differently next time
  - Focus the work more tightly on the most valuable thing, producing custom documents, and “outsource" the database stuff to an existing spreadsheet app.
  - Design our solution to be less self-contained and more workflow-agnostic.
  - See the work not as product design, but service design: make teammates of our business stakeholders, and create new processes rather than new tools.
