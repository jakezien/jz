# About

## Who I am 
I’m Jake Zien, a person living on a mossy rock floating in nothing.

I'm interested in people, perception, the world we’ve invented for ourselves, and why it is how it is. I'm interested in how meaning is made, how our tools affect our communication and visa versa.

## What I’m like
I am cereberal and have a sense of humor that is dry and crude. I take pride in being a good storyteller, but it's hard for me to say so because I think humility is very important. I will not let you exit the elevator before me, but I will probably get too walk much faster than you by accident. I really like making you laugh, but I like learning from you more. 

## What I do
I’m a design leader working across the product development process, from strategy, discovery and definition to execution, delivery and ongoing iteration. I’m especially interested in how the structure of an organization, the culture of its people, and the way things are currently done act as constraints on making something new. 
My path began with a degree in graphic design and programming. This honed my visual skills and opened an interest in positioning, semiotics, perception, and how meaning is made. My early jobs in UI design led me to UX, and ultimately to a blend of responsibilities that draw on Product Management, team leadership, experience design, information architecture, branding, and front-end development.
