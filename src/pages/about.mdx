# About

## Who I am 
I’m Jake Zien, a person living on a mossy rock floating in nothing.

I'm interested in people, perception, the world we’ve invented for ourselves, and why it is how it is. I'm interested in how meaning is made, how our tools affect our communication and visa versa.

## What I’m like
I am cereberal and have a sense of humor that is dry and crude. I take pride in being a good storyteller, but it's hard for me to say so because I think humility is very important. I will not let you exit the elevator before me, but I will probably get too walk much faster than you by accident. I really like making you laugh, but I like learning from you more. 

## What I do
I’m a design leader working across the product development process, from strategy, discovery and definition to execution, delivery and ongoing iteration. I’m especially interested in how the structure of an organization, the culture of its people, and the way things are currently done act as constraints on making something new. 
My path began with a degree in graphic design and programming. This honed my visual skills and opened an interest in positioning, semiotics, perception, and how meaning is made. My early jobs in UI design led me to UX, and ultimately to a blend of responsibilities that draw on Product Management, team leadership, experience design, information architecture, branding, and front-end development. 

## What I’ve done
### CBRE — Lead product designer
March 2020-Present
In this role, I lead design strategy for systems-level projects that affect applications used by CBRE employees on every continent. I work with CBRE’s top executives as stakeholders and partners, and collaborate with a team of designers across the globe.

### CBRE Build — Senior product designer; Creative director
Jan 2017–Mar 2020
I initiated and led a project to create a new brand identity for our new team at CBRE. When our startup, Floored, was acquired by the Big Green Machine, we sacrificed our name and logo — and with them, our ability to recruit NYC’s best technologists. To me, this was a branding issue, so I developed a new visual, verbal, and cultural identity that defined our group’s position and role to our new parent company — and to our existing team. I collaborated with CBRE’s Global Marketing Team, culminating in a final, one-on-one pitch to CBRE CEO Bob Sulentic, who received it with warm enthusiasm and a big thumbs up. The project was featured on Brand New. Events, swag, recruiting success.
Also at CBRE Build, I co-led a team to develop Site IQ, a application built from the ground up. 
Also touched half a dozen other products.

### Floored — Lead designer
Summer 2012 – Dec 2016
I was the second employee of this startup. Hired initially as a contract UI designer to make a logo and website, I grew the role to a full time product design position, stumbling often and learning UX fundamentals on the fly.  For the first two years, I was the company’s only design or product person. I led the design for Floored’s two products, web apps for 3D real estate tours and floor planning. 
Challenges of designing for a tough user and coming into the design process too late.

### Quirky — Contract UI designer
2012
I was hired to produce UI designs for Quirky’s iOS app, which allowed users to view, comment on, and vote for invention ideas, as well as submit ideas of their own.

### Stamped — Product designer
2011
Straight out of college, I was the first design hire at this NYC-based social media startup. (In a savvy move by Stamped’s founders, I was quickly paired with a manager/mentor, a designer with a decade of experience at Google and Apple.) Our app had a great idea and a unique, typographically-driven, ahead-of-its time UI. Justin Bieber was an early user, John Gruber wrote approvingly of our launch, and after less than 2 years, the company found a $10m exit in an acqui-hire by Yahoo.

### RISD — BFA Graphic Design, Brown University — Minor in Computer Science
2007–2011
I took advantage of the two schools’ cross registration policy to supplement my RISD graphic design education with computer science classes at Brown. My thesis project, Points, imagined a future where design software shed its painterly roots in favor of tools and workflows more appropriate to screen design. (This future is now playing out in Sketch and Figma.) Honors included a faculty award for my thesis project, personal invitation to dine at the home of RISD’s president, and ____________.

### Nicolet High School
2003-2007
You don’t really care what I did in high school, do you? I was on the studious track, the one crammed with AP exams, honor rolls, early mornings and late nights. Though I felt my true passions lay in design, my specialty extracurricular was theater, where I played the following roles. [link to oklahoma on yt]
